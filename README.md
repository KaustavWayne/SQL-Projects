## 🚀 Overview  
This repository contains an **SQL-based project** designed to extract insights, optimize queries, and analyze structured datasets.  
The goal is to apply **SQL fundamentals, advanced queries, and business logic** to solve real-world data problems.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Write **optimized SQL queries** for analytics  
- Practice **aggregations, joins, subqueries, and CTEs**  
- Explore **date/time and window functions**  
- Build **business-style case studies** using SQL  
- Organize queries into **Easy, Medium, Advanced** difficulty levels  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools  
- **SQL Engines**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- **DB Client**: DBeaver / pgAdmin / MySQL Workbench  
- **GitHub** for version control & sharing

## 🧩 SQL Schema Assumptions  
Example – replace with your project’s schema.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Country VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    Amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
```

## 📊 Example Queries

### ✅ Easy
- Retrieve all customers from India  
- List the top 5 highest order amounts  

### ⚡ Medium
- Find the total revenue generated per customer  
- Calculate monthly sales trends  

### 🚀 Advanced
- Use a CTE to calculate the difference between highest and lowest order values per customer  
- Apply window functions to rank customers by revenue

## ⚡ Installation & Usage

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-sql-project.git
cd your-sql-project
```

Import schema & dataset into your SQL engine (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite), then run queries:
```bash
# Example: PostgreSQL (psql)
psql -U your_user -d your_db -f schema/schema.sql
psql -U your_user -d your_db -f sql_questions.sql
```
